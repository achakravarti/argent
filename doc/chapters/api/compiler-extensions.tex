\chapter{Compiler Extensions}

GCC provides a rich set of compiler extensions to the C language standards
through the \texttt{\_\_attribute\_\_} keyword. These compiler extensions allow 
special properties to be specified to types, enumerators, statements, functions, 
and variables. These special properties, applied through the 
\texttt{\_\_attribute\_\_} keyword, are used by GCC to perform optimisations and
provide other enhancements beyond what the C standard specifies.

Experience has shown that careful use of these extensions is beneficial,
especially if we know that the code is to be compiled on GCC, or a GCC-
compatible compiler such as Clang that supports the 
\texttt{\_\_attribute\_\_} keyword.

The Argent Library uses a few selected such extensions, and wraps them as macros
so that they degrade gracefully (with an appropriate warning) when ported to 
compilers that do not support the \texttt{\_\_attribute\_\_} extensions provided
 by GCC.
